Business analyst: Sure, I can help you with that. Let's start by breaking down the requirements into smaller components.

1. User Authentication and Authorization: The system should allow users to register and log in to the website. Users should be able to create their own accounts and passwords, and they should be able to log out of the system when they are finished. Additionally, the system should have a mechanism for verifying user identities, such as email addresses or phone numbers.
2. User registration and login functionality: The system should allow users to create new accounts by providing their name, email address, password, and any other relevant information. Users should be able to log in to the system using their email address and password.
3. Product Management: The system should allow administrators to manage products on the website. They should be able to add new products, edit existing products, and delete products from the website. Additionally, they should be able to view sales data for each product.
4. Shopping Cart: The system should allow users to add items to their shopping carts and remove items from their shopping carts. Users should be able to view the contents of their shopping carts and make changes to them.
5. Order Processing: The system should allow administrators to process orders that have been placed by customers. They should be able to view order details, such as the customer's name, email address, and shipping information. Additionally, they should be able to mark orders as shipped and update order statuses.
6. Search and Navigation: The system should allow users to search for products on the website using keywords or phrases. It should also have a navigation menu that allows users to easily find the products they are looking for.
7. Design document: The system should have a clear and concise design document that outlines the architecture, user interface, and functionality of the system. This will help ensure that everyone involved in the development process has a shared understanding of what the system is supposed to do.

Please let me know if you need any further clarification on these requirements.
