[Write a Python program that generates company business card.Your program should accept name,title and email information entered by the user. Then, the designed business card image should contain these three pieces of information.I hope there will be a unified slogan in the lower right corner of the business card: ‘AGI For Lives’ and there here is a company name in the upper right corner: ‘ModelBest’. Finally, the program should save the business card image to a file, allowing the user to specify the file name and format (e.g., PNG, JPG).Make sure to provide a user-friendly interface that guides the user through the process of inputting the data and specifying the file name and format for the business card  image. Test your program with various inputs to ensure it generates valid business card  and handles different data types gracefully.]
