# Running Game User Manual

## Introduction

Welcome to the Running Game! This is a simple, endless game where you control a pixelated block and try to avoid obstacles for as long as possible. The game features a 2D side-scrolling interface and a pixelated art style.

## Installation

To play the Running Game, you need to have Python installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Once you have Python installed, you can install the game dependencies by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install the necessary dependencies, including the Pygame library.

## How to Play

To start the game, run the `main.py` file using Python. You can do this by navigating to the game's directory in your terminal or command prompt and running the following command:

```
python main.py
```

Once the game starts, you can control the block by pressing the spacebar. Pressing the spacebar will make the block jump, allowing you to avoid obstacles.

The goal of the game is to survive for as long as possible and achieve a high score. The score is displayed on the top left corner of the screen. Every time you successfully avoid an obstacle, your score will increase by one.

If the block collides with an obstacle, the game will end and a "Game Over" panel will be displayed. You can restart the game by pressing the spacebar again.

## Customization

If you want to customize the game, you can modify the `main.py` file. Here are some things you can change:

- `screen_width` and `screen_height`: These variables control the size of the game window. You can change them to adjust the game's resolution.

- `block_size`: This variable controls the size of the block. You can change it to make the block bigger or smaller.

- `obstacle_speed`: This variable controls the speed at which the obstacles move. You can change it to make the game easier or harder.

- `obstacle_width` and `obstacle_height`: These variables control the size of the obstacles. You can change them to make the obstacles bigger or smaller.

- `gravity`: This variable controls the gravity effect on the block. You can change it to make the block jump higher or lower.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully installed and played the Running Game. Enjoy the endless running and try to achieve the highest score possible. Have fun!
