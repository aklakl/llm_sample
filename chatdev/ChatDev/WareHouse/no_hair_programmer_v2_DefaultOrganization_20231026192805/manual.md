# Programmer Life Reboot Simulator User Manual

## Introduction

The Programmer Life Reboot Simulator is an application that simulates the life of a programmer. Users can click the "Go On" button to progress through different stages of their programming career and see the related events that occur. The simulator starts with the user at 18 years old with a full head of hair. Each click of the "Go On" button advances the user's age by a random number of years between 1 and 10. The simulator then displays a random event related to the user's programming career, which can either result in gaining more hair or losing hair. The hair loss levels range from "秃头" (bald) to "多毛症" (excessive hair). If the user reaches the "秃头" level, the game ends.

## Installation

To use the Programmer Life Reboot Simulator, you need to have Python installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Usage

To start the Programmer Life Reboot Simulator, follow these steps:

1. Open a command prompt or terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where you have saved the "main.py" file.
3. Run the following command to start the simulator:

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

4. The simulator window will open, displaying the user's age and hair status.
5. Click the "Go On" button to progress through different stages of the user's programming career.
6. Each click of the "Go On" button will update the user's age and display a random event related to their programming career.
7. If the user reaches the "秃头" level, a message box will appear, indicating the end of the game and displaying the user's final age.

## Example

Here is an example of how the simulator works:

1. The user starts at 18 years old with "乌黑浓密" (full head of hair).
2. The user clicks the "Go On" button.
3. The user's age increases by a random number of years (e.g., 5) and becomes 23.
4. A random event related to the user's programming career is displayed (e.g., "你在大学选择了计算机专业，开始疯狂掉发，现在你的发量是隐约掉发").
5. The user clicks the "Go On" button again.
6. The user's age increases by another random number of years (e.g., 3) and becomes 26.
7. Another random event related to the user's programming career is displayed.
8. This process continues until the user reaches the "秃头" level or decides to stop playing.

## Conclusion

The Programmer Life Reboot Simulator allows users to experience the ups and downs of a programmer's career. By clicking the "Go On" button, users can progress through different stages of their programming life and see the related events. Have fun playing and see if you can reach the pinnacle of a programmer's life - "秃头"!
