Task:
 Write a Python program that generates QR codes. Your program should take user input for the data or text that needs to be encoded in the QR code. It should then use a suitable library or package to generate a QR code image from the input data. Finally, the program should save the QR code image to a file, allowing the user to specify the file name and format (e.g., PNG, JPG).Make sure to provide a user-friendly interface that guides the user through the process of inputting the data and specifying the file name and format for the QR code image. Test your program with various inputs to ensure it generates valid QR codes and handles different data types gracefully.
