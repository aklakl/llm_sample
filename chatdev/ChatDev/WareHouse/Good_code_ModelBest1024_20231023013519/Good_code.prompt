Build a file content conversion tool. When I select a Python file, I add a line of comments at the end of each line of code in the file to praise the programmer. The perspectives of praise should be as diverse as possible, including the logical clarity of the code and the novelty of his ideas. If I cannot find praise, I will randomly select some from other good qualities to praise him
