Task:
Develop a captivating 'Red Packet Rain' game in Python that engages users from the start. The program commences with a file selection pop-up window, empowering users to precisely define the file path for an image representing a red envelope. The chosen image undergoes intelligent resizing for seamless integration into the program, smoothly transitioning to demo mode. In demo mode, a new window emerges against an elegant black background, setting the stage for a visually immersive experience. User-uploaded images descend slowly in sequence from random starting points at the top of the page, leaving no trace on the vertical path. Simultaneously, a dynamic scoreboard in the top left corner enhances user interaction, displaying the format 'score:xxx' with an initial setting of zero. Each aesthetically pleasing image serves as an interactive element. Clicking on an image results in its disappearance, accompanied by a random increase in the score on the scoreboard, ranging from 1 to 6. The game unfolds with excitement, and upon reaching a score of 100, the program concludes with a heartfelt congratulatory note.
