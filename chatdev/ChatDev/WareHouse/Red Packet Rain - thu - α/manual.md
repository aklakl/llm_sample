## ðŸ¤” What is this?

The 'Red Packet Rain' game is a visually immersive experience where user-uploaded images descend slowly in sequence from random starting points at the top of the page. The game begins with a file selection pop-up window, allowing users to select an image file representing a red envelope. The chosen image undergoes intelligent resizing for seamless integration into the game.

In the game, a dynamic scoreboard in the top left corner displays the score, starting from zero. Each image serves as an interactive element. Clicking on an image results in its disappearance, accompanied by a random increase in the score on the scoreboard, ranging from 1 to 6. The game concludes when the score reaches 100, with a heartfelt congratulatory note.
