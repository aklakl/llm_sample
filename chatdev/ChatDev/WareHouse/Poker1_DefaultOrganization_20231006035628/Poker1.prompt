Create a Texas Hold'em Poker game that adheres to the official No Limit Texas Hold'em rules. The game should simulate a poker tournament with 1 human player and 4 AI characters. Each player, including the human player and AI characters, starts with $1000 in chips. The tournament begins with blinds set at $5 for the small blind and $10 for the big blind. The blinds will follow the World Poker Tour incremental blinds guidelines, increasing at regular intervals. Ensure that the blinds increase according to these guidelines to maintain a challenging pace. For AI character decision-making, they should employ basic poker theory for most of their actions, striving to make optimal choices based on their hands and the community cards. However, each AI character should also have the ability to make occasional 'random' decisions, deviating from optimal play to add an element of unpredictability and excitement to the game. The game should provide a realistic poker experience, including actions such as checking, betting, raising, calling, and folding. It should accurately track the chip counts of all players, manage the community cards and the deck, and determine the winner(s) of each hand. Please generate a detailed description and implementation plan for this Texas Hold'em Poker game, specifying how the AI characters will make decisions and interact with the human player. Additionally, outline the algorithm for increasing blinds according to the World Poker Tour guidelines.
