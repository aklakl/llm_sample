Task:
Create a Python program that offers a one-click background removal feature for user-uploaded images. The program should provide a user-friendly interface for uploading an image file. Once the user uploads an image, the program should automatically remove the background and display or provide a downloadable version of the image with the background removed.
You can use a suitable library or algorithm for image processing and background removal, such as a pre-trained deep learning model like U-Net, Mask R-CNN, or a library like OpenCV. Ensure that the process is fast and user-friendly, with clear instructions for the user to follow.
The program should also allow the user to choose between different output formats (e.g., PNG or JPEG) and provide the option to adjust the level of background removal or transparency if needed. Test your program with various images to verify its accuracy and usability
